# Scraping Issues

### src/scraping/automated_scraper.py
- There were a handful of games with no available betting data (~10 per team); these games weren't included in the saved file
- These games were scattered around, but usually occuring in the earlier seasons (pre 2010) for each team
- Could be due to insufficient data or OddsPortal bugs
